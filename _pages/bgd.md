[Introduction to Graphs](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_1/) :  What is a graph ? Where are graphs being used ? What are the components of a graph ?

[Graph Analysis, Erdos-RÃ©nyi, Barabasi-Albert](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_2/) :  In this article, we cover the two main types of graphs, and describe a first approach to graph analysis. 

[Graph Algorithms](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_3/) : We'll now explore the main graph algorithms and several use cases in a visual way with direct examples in Python. 

[Graph Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_4/) :  How can we handle missing links or missing nodes in graphs ? 

[Introduction to Neo4J and Graph Databases](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Neo4J/) : Neo4J is a graph oriented database that is widely used for anomaly detection or real time recommendation. We'll cover the basics of Neo4J here.

[A day at the Neo4J Graph Tour](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Neo4J_gt/) : I had the pleasure to attend the Neo4J Graph Tour 2019.

[Install Zeppelin Locally](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/zeppelin_local/) : How to easily install Zeppelin on your local computer ? 

[Run a Zeppelin Notebook in AWS EMR](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/zeppelin_emr/) : Running Zeppelin locally is good. But at the time of Big Data analytics, how can you launch Zeppelin on AWS EMR ?

[Working with Amazon S3 Buckets](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/storage/) : S3 buckets offer great storage solutions for your Big Data projects. We'll see how to get a simple example to work.

[Launch and access an AWS EC2 Cluster](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/EC2/) : A quick overview of how to work with AWS EC2 and establish SSH connection with it.

[Install Apache Cassandra on an AWS EC2 Cluster](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/EC2_Cassandra/) : Cassandra is a No-SQL approach store large amount of data. In this article, we'll see how to install it on your EC2 cluster.

[Install Zookeeper on EC2 instances](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/ZK/) : How can you install Zookeeper on EC2 instances for a resilient architecture ?

[Install Apache Spark on EC2 instances](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Spark/) : An article on how to install Spark on EC2 instances and get your Big Data platform ready !

[Big (Open)  Data , the GDELT Project](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/zeppelin-GDELT/) : We'll introduce GDELT, an open source database with several Tb of data available. 

[Build an ETL in Scala for GDELT Data](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Scala/) : How can you process such a large amount of data using Scala and S3 ?

[Understanding Computer Components](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/comp_components) : In order to fully understand the cloud concepts, I wrote a quick article on the main components of computers.

[Introduction to Hadoop](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/hadoop) : In this article, we'll cover the basics of Hadoop, a quick history, and an overview of the main features of Hadoop.

[MapReduce](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/MapReduce) : MapReduce is a programming paradigm that allows to process a large amount of data by initially splitting the data into blocks, sending the blocks to different clusters to perform operations, and aggregating the results.

[HDFS](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/HDFS) : HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is a sub-project of Hadoop. HDFS lets you connect nodes contained within clusters over which data files are distributed, overall being fault-tolerant.

[VM's in Virtual Box](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/VM) : Hadoop runs only on GNU/Linux platforms. Therefore, if you have another OS, you need to install Virtual Box. Virtual Box is a software that lets you create and run Virtual Machines.
