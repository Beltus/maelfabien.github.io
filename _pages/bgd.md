A series of articles dedicated to Big Data analytics.

## Parallel and Distributed Computing

[Understanding Computer Components](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/comp_components)

Articles to come on Map-Reduce, GPUs...

## Amazon Web Services

[Cloud Concepts](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/cloud_concept/) : What is Cloud Computing ? What are the main concepts behind it ?

[Core Services](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/core_services/) : What are the core services of AWS and other Cloud providers ?

## Google Cloud Platform

[TPU survival guide on Google Colaboratory](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/ColabTPU/) : TPUs are changing the way we are training Neural Networks. Developped by Google, TPUs have a different way to perform matrix operations and are optimized for certain tasks. We'll cover the basics of TPU computation, and how to use them in Colab.

[Using Google Drive to save and load files in Colab](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/ColabDrive/) : Google Colab offers CPUs, GPUs and TPUs for free. It's a great tool for any project, but you need to have your files uploaded on Google Drive. We'll see how to interact with Google Drive from Colab.

## Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana

[Introduction to the Elastic Stack](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/ElasticStack/) : What is the Elastic Stack ? What are the main products and features of ELK ?

[Getting started with Elastic Cloud and Kibana](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/ElasticCloud/) : Elastic Cloud allows on demand cluster deployment. It is an easy way to deploy your platform within seconds, and start visualization with Kibana.

[Install and run Elasticsearch + Kibana locally](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Elasticsearch/) : How can you install Elasticsearch and Kibana locally ? We'll also cover a Heartbeat metric for your computer.

[Working with Dev Tools in Elasticsearch](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/DevTools/) : DevTools is the default interpreter to interact with your data in Elasticsearch. We'll cover the basic queries and data manipulations.

## Neo4J

[Introduction to Graphs](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_1/) :  What is a graph ? Where are graphs being used ? What are the components of a graph ?

[Graph Analysis, Erdos-RÃ©nyi, Barabasi-Albert](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_2/) :  In this article, we cover the two main types of graphs, and describe a first approach to graph analysis. 

[Graph Algorithms](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_3/) : We'll now explore the main graph algorithms and several use cases in a visual way with direct examples in Python. 

[Graph Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/graph_4/) :  How can we handle missing links or missing nodes in graphs ? 

[Introduction to Neo4J and Graph Databases](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Neo4J/) : Neo4J is a graph oriented database that is widely used for anomaly detection or real time recommendation. We'll cover the basics of Neo4J here.

[A day at the Neo4J Graph Tour](https://maelfabien.github.io/bigdata/Neo4J_gt/) : I had the pleasure to attend the Neo4J Graph Tour 2019.
