[The Rosenblatt's Perceptron](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/Perceptron/) : An introduction to the basic building block of deep learning.

[Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/mlp/) : The MLP, or Artificial Neural Network, is a widely used algorithm in Deep Learning. What is it ? How do they learn ?

[Full introduction to Neural Nets](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/intro/) : A full introduction to Neural Nets from the Deep Learning Course in Pytorch by Facebook (Udacity).

[How do Neural Networks learn?](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/feed/) : Dive into feedforward process and back-propagation.

[Activation functions in DL](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/act/) : An overview of the different activation functions in Deep Learning, how to implement them in Python, their advantages and disadvantages.

[Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_0/) : What is NLP ? What is it used for ?

[Text Preprocessing](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_1/) : Preprocessing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process by which we try to "standardize" the text we want to analyze.

[Text Embedding with Bag-Of-Words and TF-IDF](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_2/) : In order to analyze text and run algorithms on it, we need to embed the text. The notion of embedding simply means that we'll conver the input text into a set of numerical vectors that can be used into algorithms. In this article, we'll cover BOW and TF-IDF, two simple techniques for embedding.

[Text Embedding with Word2Vec](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_3/) : A deeper dive into the state of the art embedding technique : Word2Vec.
