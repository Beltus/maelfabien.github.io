A series of articles dedicated to deep learning.

## Theory of Deep Neural Networks

[The Rosenblatt's Perceptron](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/Perceptron/) : An introduction to the basic building block of deep learning.

[Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/mlp/) : The MLP, or Artificial Neural Network, is a widely used algorithm in Deep Learning. What is it ? How do they learn ?

[Prevent Overfitting of Neural Netorks](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/regu/) : Your  model overfits ? One of these techniques should help ! We'll cover class imbalance, data augmentation, regularization, early stopping, reducing learning rate...

[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/cnn/) : CNNs changed the field of Computer Vision. How do CNNs work ? What can they be used for ?

## Architectures

[A guide to Inception Architectures in Keras](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/inception/) : Inception is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that was introduced for the first time in 2014. It won the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC14). 

[Xception and the Depthwise Separable Convolutions](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/xception/) : Xception is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that involves Depthwise Separable Convolutions. It was developped by Google researchers. 

[Create an Auto-Encoder using Keras functional API](https://maelfabien.github.io/deeplearning/autoencoder/) : Autoencoder is a type a neural network widely used for unsupervised dimension reduction. So, how does it work ? What can it be used for ? And how do we implement it in Python ?
