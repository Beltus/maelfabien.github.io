I have visited some places and countries so far. I am trying to keep and up-to-date list of all places I have visited to in this map:

I also have a 4 months travel planned with my girlfriend. We will leave in December 2019 and come back in March 2020. We will go to:
- Cambodia
- Vietnam
- New Zealand
- French Polynesia
- Easter Island
- Chili
- and see if we have some time left to visit some other countries

The itinerary we'll follow during this 4 month is more or less this one:

In the sections below, I will be sharing pictures that I take during the trip, and pictures of previous travels.
