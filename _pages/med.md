In this section, I'm sharing all papers and Medium articles I have written, as well as any other article that I publish outside of this blog :  

# Deep Learning : Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (Text, Sound, Video)

In this research project in partnership with the French Employment Agency, we explored state of the art models in multimodal sentiment analysis. We have chosen to explore textual, sound and video inputs, and predict emotions / psychological traits associated to each modality. We developped a Flask web app that gathers all this information, and presents a visualization of the performance of the person.

# A Deep Learning Approach to Face Classification

In this challenge, our aim was to develop face classification algorithms using Deep Learning Architectures. I have explored hand-made CNNs, Inception, XCeption, VGG16, DenseNet or ResNet networks for binary classification purposes.

# Written for other blogs

I also write articles for companies (if you think we could work together, feel free to reach out !) :

[Who's the painter? - For explorium.ai](https://www.explorium.ai/blog/whos-the-painter/) : An illustration of how data enrichment and feature engineering can improve a model.
