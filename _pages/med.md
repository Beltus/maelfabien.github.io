In this section, I'm sharing all papers and Medium articles I have written, as well as any other article that I publish outside of this blog :  

# Deep Learning : Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (Text, Sound, Video)

In this project, I am exploring state of the art models in multimodal sentiment analysis. We have chosen to explore textual, sound and video inputs and develop an ensemble model that gathers the information from all these sources and displays it in a clear and interpretable way.

I am currently working on a Tensorflow.js implementation of this project. Don't hesite to Star the project if you like it.

# A Deep Learning Approach to Face Classification

In this challenge, our aim was to develop face classification algorithms using Deep Learning Architectures. I have explored hand-made CNNs, Inception, XCeption, VGG16, DenseNet or ResNet networks for binary classification purposes.
