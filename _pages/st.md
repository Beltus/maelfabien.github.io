A series of articles dedicated to statistics.

## Linear Model

[Key Resources](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/resources/) : Some important resources to to understand the basics of statistics.

[Linear Regression in 1 Dimension](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/linreg/) : The simplest framework, in which we try to predict a value from a single variable. We'll cover the maths the OLS, and applications in Python.

[Multidimensional Linear Regression](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/linreg2/) : What if we now add several variables to our model ? What does it imply ?

[Random Design Matrix](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/rnddesign/) : Most of the time, the OLS frameword cannot be achieved. What happens when we can't be sure that the values we observe are fully deterministic ? In this article, we'll cover a simple extension.

[Normal Regression Model](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/normal/) : We'll add a normality hypothesis for the residuals.

[Pseudo Least Squares](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/pseudols/) : If the solution of OLS is not unique and we have too many features compared to the number of observations, we cannot invert the Gram Matrix.

[Transformations of Linear Models](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/Special/) : In this quick article, weâ€™ll introduce some extensions / transformations of the linear regression model for further flexibility.

[Boolean and categorical variables](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/Boolean/) : The features we collect are not always continuous. How do we handle boolean or categorical data in linear regression framework ?

[Dealing with heteroscedasticity](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/hetero/) : So far, we made the hypothesis that the variablity was equal across the range of values of the features. What happens when it's not the case ?

[Generalized Least Squares](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/GLS/) : Introduction to a more general regression framework.

## Statistical Hypothesis testing

[Basics of Statistical Hypothesis testing](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/Tests/) : How do we assess if a parameter is significant or not ? We'll cover statistical tests, hypothesis and joint tests.

## Time Series

[Introduction to Time Series](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/TimeSeries1/) : A first approach to exploring a time series in Python with open data.

[Key Concepts in Time Series](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/TimeSeries2/) : Stationarity, ergodicity... We'll cover those concepts and illustrate them in Python !

## Matlab

[Statistics in Matlab](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/matlab/) : Matlab remains a widely used language for statistics. In this article, we cover the main statistical topics in Matlab.
