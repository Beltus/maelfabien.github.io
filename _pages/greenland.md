*Dates:* 05.09.2016 - 14.09.2016
*Place:* Tasiilaq, South-East Greenland

I had the chance to visit South Greenland during a 2 weeks treck with my grand-mother back in 2016. The culture is incredibly rich and strong. Most inhabitants live from fishing, and recieve a monthly salary from the Danish government.

In Greenlandic, the country is called "Kalaallit Nunaat" which means "land of the Kalaallit". The Kalaallit is the name of the western Intuits.

Funny facts:
- It is the largest island in the world
- It is part of the North American continent
- It is politically attached to Denmark
- It is the least densely populated region in the world (under 60'000 inhabitants)

The temperature reached over 23°C when I was then. In the night, we could expect on average between -5°C and 0°C. Due to those heat waves, the landscape was changing daily. The ice melted at a record speed. The local guide told us that some ice walls lost ground over 100 meters since the started working there, 5 years ago.
