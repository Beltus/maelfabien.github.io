*Dates:* 05.09.2016 - 14.09.2016
*Place:* Narsarsuaq, Extreme South Greenland

I had the chance to visit South Greenland during a 2 weeks treck with my grand-mother (who was aged 71 at that time!) back in 2016. In Greenlandic, the country is called "Kalaallit Nunaat" which means "land of the Kalaallit". The Kalaallit is the name of the western Intuits.

Funny facts:
- It is the largest island in the world
- It is part of the North American continent
- It is politically attached to Denmark
- It is the least densely populated region in the world (under 60'000 inhabitants)
- Inhabitants recieve a pension from the Danish government
- You cannot move to Greenland without marrying an Inuit

Less Funny fact:
The temperature reached over 23°C when I was then. In the night, we could expect on average between -5°C and 0°C. Due to those heat waves, the landscape was changing daily. The ice melted at a record speed. The local guide told us that some ice walls lost ground over 100 meters since the started working there, 5 years ago.

We left from Reykjavic, Iceland. We only had time to explore the city before taking off. There's a funny atmosphere, it gets dark early at that time, and a good part of the economy of the city seems to be concentrated in the harbour.

We had the chance to do a boat tour and see dolphins before flying to Greenland!

We then took a flight to Narsarsuaq, a city at the extreme south of Greenland.

Narsarsuaq is the only city with a valid runway in South Greenland. The airport is actually an old American camp used during the second world war. When we landed, the weather was surprisingly hot!

We then headed to Qassiarsuk, a village of 35 inhabitants.

The only way to get to our hotel in Qassiarsuk was to take a boat. We arrived in a small hostel, the Leif Eriksson Hostel, which was by the way the only moment of the trip where we had Internet access and hot showers.

The landscape around the hotel is incredible.
