A series of articles dedicated to machine learning and statistics.

## Statistics

[Key Resources](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/resources/) : Some important resources to to understand the basics of statistics.

[A Full Guide to Linear Regression (Part 1)](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/linreg/) : We'll explore the simple framework of OLS and multi-dimensional regression.

[A Full Guide to Linear Regression (Part 2)](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/linreg2/) : Random design matrix, Normal regression, Pseudo Least Squares and other extensions...

[Basics of Statistical Hypothesis testing](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/Tests/) : How do we assess if a parameter is significant or not ? We'll cover statistical tests, hypothesis and joint tests.

[The Logistic Regression](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/linreg3/) : The Logistic Regression brings a way to operate binary classification using underlying linear models. We'll cover the basics of LR, the parameters to use and examples in Python.

## Time Series

[Introduction to Time Series](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/TimeSeries1/) : A first approach to exploring a time series in Python with open data.

[Key Concepts in Time Series](https://maelfabien.github.io/statistics/TimeSeries2/) : Stationarity, ergodicity... We'll cover those concepts and illustrate them in Python !

## Data Visualization

[Tableau-like in Python with Altair](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Altair/) : Altair is a great Python library to create dashboards and interactive graphs like in Tableau.


## Supervised Learning Algorithms

[Supervised Learning Cheat Sheet](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/supervised/) : A cheat sheet that recaps the main supervised learning algorithms. It includes an illustration, and the minimization problem for each of them.

[Basics and Motivation](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/ml_base/) : A first approach to machine learning. We'll go over the main motivations, the main kind of algorithms, what they can be used for...

[Bayes Classifier](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/bayes/) : At the core of any algorithm, the Bayes Classifier is considered as one of the first algorithm to master.

[Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and QDA](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/LDA/) : In this article, we'll cover the intuition behind LDA, when it should be used, and the maths behind it. We'll also quick cover the Quadratic version of LDA.

[Adaptative Boosting (AdaBoost)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/adaboost/) : A clear approach of boosting algorithms and adaptative boosting with illustrations. When should we use boosting ? What are the foundations of the algorithm ?

[Large Scale Kernel Methods](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/largescale/) : Kernel methods offer a great way to solve complex problems. However, it gets computationally hard to implement them at scale. This is being solved by Large Scale Kernel methods.

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms 

[Unsupervised Learning Cheat Sheet](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/unsupervised/) : A cheat sheet that recaps the main unsupervised learning algorithms. It includes an illustration, and the minimization problem for each of them.

[Text Embedding with Bag-Of-Words and TF-IDF](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/NLP_2/) : In order to analyze text and run algorithms on it, we need to embed the text. The notion of embedding simply means that we'll conver the input text into a set of numerical vectors that can be used into algorithms. In this article, we'll cover BOW and TF-IDF, two simple techniques for embedding.
