A series of tutorials and Computer Vision articles I have realized on different topics.

## Theory

[Introduction to Computer Vision](https://maelfabien.github.io/computervision/cv_1/) : What is Computer Vision ? What are the main concepts ? When should it be used ?

[Image Formation and Filtering](https://maelfabien.github.io/computervision/cv_2/) : How are images formed ? Filters can be applied on the image to extract information. What filters can we use ?

[Advanced Filtering and Transformations](https://maelfabien.github.io/computervision/cv_3/) : In this article, we'll cover advanced filtering and image transformation techniques.

[Local features, Detection, Description and Matching](https://maelfabien.github.io/computervision/cv_4/) : Local features are used for object tracking for example. We'll see how to implement them, and cover othe topics.

[Images Alignment](https://maelfabien.github.io/computervision/cv_5/) : When you take a panorama, the image needs to be aligned. How is it done ?

## Tutorials

[A full guide to face detection](https://maelfabien.github.io/tutorials/face-detection/) : Face Detection using Cascade Classifier, Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Convolutional Neural Networks.

[How to use OpenPose on macOS ?](https://maelfabien.github.io/tutorials/open-pose/) : OpenPose is a C++ / Python library for Pose Estimation. Let's see how to use it in macOS !
