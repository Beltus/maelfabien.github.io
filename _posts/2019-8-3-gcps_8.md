In the previous article, we saw how we could leverage the use of BigQuery SQL queries for data exploration. I also mentioned the fact that we could use DataStudio for data exploration.

We can open DataStudio from BigQuery. To do so, type the following SQL query to select all columns of the San Francisco Bike Sharing database.

```
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` LIMIT 100000
```

Then, click on "Explore With Data Studio". Of course, you can access the tool directly, not only through BigQuery. You start screen will look like this :

In the bottom right corner, you can change the dimensions in the table. Suppose we want to create a dashboard with the following information :
- a table that shows the station names ranked by number of trips
- a table that shows the station names ranked by use time in seconds
- a bar plot that shows the station names and the number of trips
- a bar plot that shows the station names and the use time in seconds

Start by changing the dimension of the table displayed on the page. The axis displayed are already the good ones. Simply delete the Date Range dimension.

Now, move the graph so that it only takes 1/4 of the screen :

We now want to add the corresponding bar chart.

The columns selected are the right ones again by default :

Notice how the views are linked. If you select multiple rows in the table, the graph will focus on those rows only :

Add a table, and change the metric to `duration_sec`.

Finally, add a bar plot to represent this informationm and change the metric and sort dimensions to `duration_sec` :

By default, the aggregation method used is to sum the duration. You might also want to check the variance in the rental duration per station for example.
