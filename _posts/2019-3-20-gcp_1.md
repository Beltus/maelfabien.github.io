The following series of articles is based on the Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform course on Coursera. This is a 1 months program, that required about 16h of work per week.
# Google Cloud Platform

## History and context

How were computing resources managed over time ?
- 1980s : Server on-premises. You own everything, and you manage it.
- 2000s : Data Centers. Rent the space, but pay and manage the hardware. No direct physical access to the computers.
- Now : First Generation Cloud with Virtualized Data Centers. You rent hardware and space, still controling and configuring virtual machines. Pay only for what you provision.
- Next : Managed Services. Completely elastic storage, processing, ML. Pay for what you use.

Google has built one of the most powerful infrastructure on the planet. On every 5 CPUs being produced worldwide, Google buys one. Google has over 100 points of presence that use private fibre, on all continents. The idea of having so many edge locations is to allow users to access the resources without having to go accross the globe, but simply get a cached version of that resource from the edge location. 

The main softwares released by Google in Data Engineering for data processing are :
- Google File System, Colossus
- MapReduce, Dremel, Flume
- BigTable
- Tensorflow
- ...

## GCP Big Data Products

First, let's look at what the different product of GCP do :

Most of the time, companies want to move from their local environment to Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, to move to the Cloud, the steps are :
- change where you compute
- impove scalability and reliability, scaling up
- change how you compute, transforming your business

Overall, GCP allows to :
- spend less on ops and administration
- incorporate real-time data into apps and architectures
- apply machine learning broadly and easily 
- become a truly data-driven company
