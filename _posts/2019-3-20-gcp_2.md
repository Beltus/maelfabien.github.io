The following series of articles is based on the Data Engineering with Google Cloud Platform course on Coursera. This is a 1 months program, that required about 16h of work per week.

# CPUs on demand with Compute Engine

CPUs on the Cloud are provided by a Compute Engine of Virtual Machines. Compute Engine allows a high level access to all underlying Virtual Machines. There is no need to SSH into every single machine for example. It also allows us to increase the number of CPUs on demand for example.

If you select preemptible machines, you get up to 80% of discount on your machine charge, but you agree to give it up if someone comes along that's willing to pay full pruce for those machines. For examples, if the jobs you are doing are distributed among other workers, you don't really care if the machine is re-assigned to someone else.

## GCP Big Data Products

First, let's look at what the different product of GCP do :

Most of the time, companies want to move from their local environment to Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, to move to the Cloud, the steps are :
- change where you compute
- impove scalability and reliability, scaling up
- change how you compute, transforming your business

Overall, GCP allows to :
- spend less on ops and administration
- incorporate real-time data into apps and architectures
- apply machine learning broadly and easily 
- become a truly data-driven company
