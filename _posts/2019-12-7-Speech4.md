> Voice activity detection is a field which consists in identifying whether someone is speaking or not at a given moment. It can be useful to launch a vocal assistant or detect emergency situations.

In this article, we will cover the main concepts behind classical approaches to voice activity detection, and implement them in Python is a small web application using Streamlit. This article is inspired by the [following repository](https://github.com/marsbroshok/VAD-python).

# High-level overview

It can be useful at first to give a high level overview of the classical approaches to Voice Activity Detection:
- Read the input file and convert is to mono
- Move a window of 20ms along the audio data
- Calculate for each window the ratio between energy of speech band and total energy for window
- If ratio is higher than a pre-defined threshold (e.g 60%), label windows as speech
- Apply median filter with length of 0.5s to smooth detected speech regions
- Represent speech regions as intervals of time

The application we will build is the following:

# Read the input file and convert it to mono

In this exercise, we will only consider the case of mono signals and not stereo, meaning that we must have a single series of values, not 2. We read the files using Scipy's wavfile module, and convert it to mono if there are 2 lists of values returned (stereo) by applying a mean of both series.

```python
import scipy.io.wavfile as wf

filename = 'test.wav'

def _read_wav(wave_file):
	# Read the input
	rate, data = wf.read(wave_file)
	channels = len(data.shape)
	filename = wave_file

	# Convert to mono
	if channels == 2 :
		data = np.mean(data, axis=1, dtype=data.dtype)
		channels = 1
	return data

read_file = _read_wav(filename)
```
