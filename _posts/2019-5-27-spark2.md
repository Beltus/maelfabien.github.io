# How to install Spark ? 

We'll explore 2 ways to install Spark :
- using the Scala API
- using the Python API (PySpark)

## Using Scala

First of all, download the Java SE Development Kit “Java SE Development Kit 8u181” from [Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Then, on [Apache Spark website](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html), download the latest version. When I did the first install, version 2.3.1 for Hadoop 2.7 was the last version.

Download the release, and save it in your Home repository. To know where it is located, type `echo $HOME` in your Terminal. It usually is `/Users/YourName/`.

To make sure that the installation is working, in your terminal, in your Home repository, type `(replace your version) :

```bash
cd spark-2.3.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin
./spark-shell
```

Your terminal should look like this :

A user interface, called the Spark Shell application UI, should also be accessible on [localhost:4040](localhost:4040).

Finally, we need to install SBT, an open-source build tool for Scala and Java projects, similar to Java's Maven and Ant.

Its main features are:
- Native support for compiling Scala code and integrating with many Scala test frameworks
- Continuous compilation, testing, and deployment
- Incremental testing and compilation (only changed sources are re-compiled, only affected tests are re-run etc.)
- Build descriptions written in Scala using a DSL
- Dependency management using Ivy (which supports Maven-format repositories)
- Integration with the Scala interpreter for rapid iteration and debugging
- Support for mixed Java/Scala projects

Installed in the terminal using :

`brew install sbt`

To check that the installation is fully working, run :

```
./spark-shell
```

You should see a Scala interpreter :
```
Welcome to
   ____              __  
  / __/__  ___ _____/ /__
 _\ \/ _ \/ _ `/ __/  '_/
/___/ .__/\_,_/_/ /_/\_\   version 2.3.1
   /_/

Using Scala version 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_181)
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

```

## Using PySpark

For PySpark, simply run :

`pip install pyspark`

Then, in your terminal, launch : `pyspark`

Observe that you now have access to a Python interpreter instead of a Scala one.

```

  / __/__  ___ _____/ /__
 _\ \/ _ \/ _ `/ __/  '_/
/__ / .__/\_,_/_/ /_/\_\   version 2.3.1
   /_/

Using Python version 3.6.5 (default, Apr 26 2018 08:42:37)
SparkSession available as 'spark'.
