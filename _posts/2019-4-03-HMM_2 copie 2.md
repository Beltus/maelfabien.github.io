# Before we start

We'll be using Jupyter Lab on this one. First of all, install Jupyter Lab, Altaire and Vega :

```pip install jupyterlab altair vega vega_datasets```

Then, launch Jupyter Lab :

```jupyter lab```

We will use data from the French population that contains for each city :
- geolocation
- population
- population density

You can download the dataset right [here](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/files/france.csv).

Just put the file in your working directory. We are now ready to go !

# The basics of Altair

Start off by importing the altair library and the file :

```python
import altair as alt 
france = 'france.csv'
```

If you want to further understand the structure of the data, read it using pandas :
