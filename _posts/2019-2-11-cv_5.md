Let's continue our work on image alignment. We'll cover into further details image warping.

For what comes next, we'll work a bit in Python. Import the following packages :

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

So far, we saw how to :
- detect features (Harris corner detector, Laplacian of Gaussians for blobs, difference of Gaussians for fast approximation of the LOG)
- the properties of the ideal feature
- the properties of the feature descriptor
- matching of local features
- feature distance metrics

We'll cover into further details image alignment.

# I. Image Warping

There is a geometric relationshop between these 2 images :

An image warping is a change of domain of an image : $$ g(x) = f(h(x)) $$. This might include translation, rotation or aspect change. These changes are said to be global parametric warping : $$ p' = T(p) $$, since the transformation can easily be described by few parameters and is the same for every input point.

To build the transformed image, we usually apply an inverse-warping :
- for every pixel $$ x' $$ in $$ g(x') $$ :
- compute the source location $$ x = \hat{h}(x') $$
- resample $$ f(x) $$ at location $$ x $$ and copy to $$ g(x') $$

This allows $$ \hat{h}(x') $$ to be defined for all pixels in $$ g(x') $$.
