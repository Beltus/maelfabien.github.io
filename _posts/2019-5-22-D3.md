To build viz on the Web, we often use HTML for page content, CSS for aesthetics, JavaScript for interaction, SVG for vector graphics… Web as a platform allows shared representation of the page called Document Object Model (DOC). Interoperability is however lost due to encapsulation of the DOM with more specialized forms. 

<script type="text/javascript" async
    src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>

A good web viz tool should reach 3 objectives :
- **Compatibility** : the tool exists in an ecosystem of related components
- **Debugging** : accessible tools must be designed to support debugging when the inevitable occurs. 
- **Performance** : Visualizations can be greatly enhanced by interaction and animation. Focusing on transformation rather than representation shifts this responsibility to the developer, improving performance while enabling animation and interaction. 

# D3.js

D3 is a JavaScript library for creating graphs and interactive visualization tools on the web.

D3 stands for **D**ata **D**riven **D**ocument. D3 answers those 3 objectives. D3’s core contribution is a visualization “kernel” rather than a framework. For high-level capability, D3 includes a collection of helper modules that sit on top of the selection-based kernel; these modules are heavily influenced by prior visualization systems, including Protovis.

In D3, we need to think about 2 primary things :
- the data
- the document 

Regarding the data, we need to :
- Load and parse the data,
- Choose an internal data structure to represent them.

For the document, we need to:
- Choose a representational structure,
- Define a mapping from the data to that structure.

As stated above, D3 allows to create interactive visualization tools, so the final step could be to make the data interactive.

Since D3 is a web-based solution, we'll mainly be working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG. I'll assume that you have at least a basic understanding of the roles of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## SVG

There are two primary ways to draw directly to a web page: SVG and the HTML Canvas. In D3, we mostly use SVG. SVG stands for Srtuctured Vector Graphics. SVG can be embedded directely in an HTML page.

```
<svg width="200" height="200">
    <rect x="10" y="10" width="125" height="125" style="fill: red; stroke:black;">
</svg>
```

<svg width="200" height="200">
    <rect x="10" y="10" width="125" height="125" style="fill: red; stroke:black;">
</svg>

In SVG, the most common shapes are :
- `<rect>`
- `<circle>`
- `<ellipse>`
- `<path>`

## Project Architecture

There are 2 ways to integrate D3 in a webpage :
- by calling the library's remotely (through an URL)
- by importing the D3 library and putting it into your `js` folder

- Project
    - css/
    - data/
    - index.html
    - js/
        - d3
        - d3.js
        - d3.min.js
        - LICENSE

## D3 Integration

To indicate our project to use the d3.js library, we simply need to add this line in the header of `index.html` :

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/d3/d3.js"></script>
```

## How to create a graph ?

Building a graph in D3 can be done in a few steps. First of all, you need to create a new `.js` file that will contain the code of the graph.

Then, you need to call that file from the HTML page, in the **body** section :

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/myfile.js"></script>
```

We start off by creating an empty canvas in the file `myfile.js` :

> **Conclusion** : That's it ! I hope this introduction to Altair was interesing. I really love to use this on my Data Viz projects. Feel free to leave a comment if you have one.
