How is an image created ? And what kind of filters can we apply on it ? We'll try to answer those questions in this article.

For what comes next, we'll work a bit in Python. Import the following packages :

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

# I. How is an image created ?

An image will always depend on :
- lighting conditions
- scene geometry
- surface properties
- camera optics

Using the imaging system, the photons that arrive at each cell are intefrated and the digitized. An image appears as a grid of intensity values, corresponding to the value of each pixel.

`0 = black, 255=white`

An image can be compared to a function $$ f : R^2 → R $$ giving an intensity at each point $$ (x,y) $$.

# II. Image filtering

A filter can be seen as any king of operator that can be applied to an image.

Filtering is often used for :
- image enhancement (denoise, resize...)
- extract information (texture, edges)
- detect patterns (template matching)

I'll use a picture I have taken recently, but feel free to use any picture you'd like as long as there is some kind color change or contrast in the image. 

```python
img = cv2.imread('vision_6.jpg')

b,g,r = cv2.split(img)
img = cv2.merge([r,g,b])

plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()
```

## 1. Noise reduction

A first way to reduce noise is to average out several noised images, but it typically requires a lot of images, which we generally do not have. We need to use smoothing filters to overcome this issue.

Smoothing filters have several properties :
- all values are positive
- they all sum to 1
- the amount of smoothing is proportional to the mask size
- it removes high-frequency components

### a. Averaging

*Intuition* : Replace each pixel by the average of its neighbors. This assumes that neighboring pixels are similar and the noise is independent from pixel to pixel.

We define a filter size, and apply a convolutional filter (moving average) on the input image.

Here's a small animation of the filter evolution :

On an image, the process leads to the following averaged image :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_3.png)

The filter, when in size $$ 2 \times 2 $$ can be expressed as :

$$ \frac {1} {4} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$

This is already implemented in OpenCV. We'll use a kernel size of $$ 15 \times 15 $$ :

```python
blur = cv2.blur(img,(5,5))

plt.figure(figsize=(15,12))

plt.subplot(121)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.title('Original')

plt.subplot(122)
plt.imshow(blur)
plt.title('Blurred')

plt.show()
```

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_9.png)

Another way to compute smoothing is to apply a Median Filtering, in which we take the median of all pixels within kernel window. This is also really easy in OpenCV :

```python
median = cv2.medianBlur(img,5)
```

### b. Linear Filtering 

*Intuition* : This involved a weighted combination of pixels in the small neighborhood of the pixel we want to estimate.

$$ g(i,j) = \sum_{k,l} f(i+k, j+l) h (k,l) $$

We call $$ h(k,I) $$ a kernel, or mask, and the problem can be rewritten using the correlation/convolution operator :
$$ G = H ⊗ F $$ .

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_5.png)

In Python :

```python
ddepth = -1 

# Define the kernel
kernel_size = 15
kernel = np.ones((kernel_size, kernel_size), dtype=np.float32)
kernel /= (kernel_size * kernel_size)

dst = cv2.filter2D(img, ddepth, kernel)

plt.figure(figsize=(15,12))

plt.subplot(121)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.title('Original')

plt.subplot(122)
plt.imshow(dst)
plt.title('Blurred')

plt.show()
```

### c. Gaussian Filtering

*Intuition* : We might want the pixels closer to the center to have more influence on the output. For this reason, we apply Gaussian filtering. It also removes high frequency components from the image. 

The Gaussian kernel is defined as :

$$ h(u,v) = \frac {1} {2 \pi \sigma^2 } e^{ - \frac {u^2 + v^2} {\sigma^2}} $$

The Gaussian Filtering is highly efficient at removing Gaussian noise in an image.

We can choose the size of the kernel or mask, and the variance, which determines the extent of smooting.

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_11.png)

In Python, Gaussian Filtering can be implemented using OpenCV :

```python
blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(img,(15,15),10)

plt.figure(figsize=(15,12))

plt.subplot(121)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.title('Original')

plt.subplot(122)
plt.imshow(blur)
plt.title('Blurred')

plt.show()
```

## 2. Convolution filters

Convolution and Correlation are slightly different operations :

1. Correlation :

$$ g(i,j) = \sum_{k,l} f(i + k, j + l) h(k,l) $$

$$ G = H ⊗ F $$ 

2. Convolution :

$$ g(i,j) = \sum_{k,l} f(i - k, j - l) h(k,l) $$

$$ G = H * F $$ 

Example of convolutions :

a. Do nothing 
![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_13.png)

b. Shift the image
![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_14.png)

c. Sharpen an image
![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_15.png)

In Python, simply use :

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

plt.imshow(2*img - blur)
plt.title('Sharpened image')

plt.show()
```

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_16.png)

d. Find only the details of an image

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_17.png)

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))

plt.imshow(img - blur)
plt.title('Edges only')

plt.show()
```

And apply this to our image :

![image](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/images/vision_18.png)


The convolution is both commutative and associative. The Fourier transform of two convolved images is the product of their individual Fourier transforms.
