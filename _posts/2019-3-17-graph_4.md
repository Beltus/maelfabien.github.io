So far, we covered the main kind of graphs, and the most basic characteristics to describe a graph. We'll now cover into more details graph analysis / algorithms and the different ways a graph can be analyzed.

For what comes next, open a Jupyter Notebook and import the following packages :

```python
import numpy as np
import random
import networkx as nx
from IPython.display import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

If you have not already installed the `networkx` paxkage, simply run :

```bash
pip install networkx
```

The following articles will be using the latest version  `2.x` of  `networkx`. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

To illustrate the different concepts we'll cover and how it applies to graphs we'll take the Karate Club example. This graph is present in the `networkx` package. It represents the relations of members of a Karate Club. However, due to a lack a agreement of the founders of the club, the club has recently been splitted in two. We'll try to illustrate this event with graphs. 

First, load and plot the graph :

```python
n=34
m = 78
G_karate = nx.karate_club_graph()

pos = nx.spring_layout(G_karate)
nx.draw(G_karate, cmap = plt.get_cmap('rainbow'), with_labels=True, pos=pos)
```

# I. What is Graph Learning ?

# Label Propagation

The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is a fast algorithm for finding communities in a graph using network structure alone as its guide, without any predefined objective function or prior information about the communities.

LPA handles semi-supervised learning for label propagation.
