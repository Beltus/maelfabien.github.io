Heteroscedasticity might be an issue when conducting hypothesis tests. How can we define heteroscedasticity ? How can we detect it ? How can we overcome this issue.

# I. What is heteroscedasticity ?

Heteroscedasticity (or heteroskedasticity) refers to the case in which the variablity is unequal across the range of values. 

Recall that in the linear regression framework : $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_k X_k + u $$. The fundamental hypothesis is that : $$ E (u \mid X_1, X_2, ..., X_k) = 0 $$. Under this hypothesis, the OLS estimator is the Best Linear Unbiaised Estimator (BLUE). 

By normality hypothesis, under homoscedasticity, $$ u \sim N(0, \sigma^2) $$ and $$ Var (u \mid X_1, ... X_k) = \sigma^2 $$.

For example, if we try to predict the income in terms of the age of a person :
- in case of homoscedasticity, the variance is constant over the age of the person, i.e 
- in case of heteroscedasticity, the variance is increasing over the age of the person

Under heteroscedasticity, $$ Var (u_i \mid X_i) = {\sigma_i}^2 $$.

# II. Transform the variables in `log`

In most cases, to control for heteroscedasticity, there is an easy trick : transform the variables in log. 

$$ log(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_k X_k + u $$

Most of the time, this will do the trick !

For example, in Matlab :

```matlab
y = log(hprice1(:,1));
[n,k] = size(hprice1);

X = [ones(n,1), hprice1(:,[3,4,5])]
beta = inv(X'*X)*X'*y
```

# III. Robust inference to heteroscedasticity 

## Concept

*Idea* : Build a standard error robust to any kind of heteroscedasticity. 

The estimators take the following form :

$$ \hat{\beta_1} = \beta_1 + \frac {\sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \hat{u_i}^2} { \sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2} $$

This estimator is robust to any kind of heteroscedasticity. The variance of the estimator is defined by :

$$ Var(\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac { \sum_i ( X_i - \bar{X})^2 {\sigma_i}^2 } {{SSR_x}^2} $$

This requires $$ \beta_1 $$ to be known and $$ u_i $$ too. We can define $$ \hat{u_i} $$ the residual of the estimation. Using White's formula:

$$ \frac {\sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \hat{u_i}^2 } {{SSR_x}^2} $$ is robust to any kind of heteroscedasticity. 

Therefore, if $$ r_{ij} is the residual of the regression of $$ X_{j} $$ on the other independant variables, we have :

$$ \hat{Var}(\hat{\beta_j}) = \frac {\sum_i \hat{r_{ij}}^2 \hat{u_i}^2 } {{SSR_j}^2} $$ where

It is sufficient to modify the reference standard error during further tests. 

## Detect heteroscedasticity 

How can we detect heteroscedasticity ? A simple test hypothesis can be used :

$$ H_0 : Var(u \mid X_1, ..., X_k) = \sigma^2 $$

# IV. Linear form residuals

The residuals in case of heteroscedasticity might depend on :
- time, with an index $$ i $$, as we have seen up to now
- other features

In the second case, the residuals should have the following form :

$$ u^2 = \delta_0 + \delta_1 X_1 + ... + \delta_k X_k + V $$. 

We can test the hypothesis $$ H_0 : \delta_1 = \delta_2 = ... = \delta_k = 0 $$

# V. Heteroscedasticity with a constant shift

This time, the hypothesis is the following :

$$ Var(u \mid x_i) = \sigma^2 h(x_i) $$

Therefore, we might need to modify the residuals :

$$ E( ( \frac {u_i} {\sqrt{h_i] } } )^2 ) = \frac {E({u_i}^2} {h_i} = \frac { \sigma^2 h_i} {h_i} = \sigma^2 $$




We can do a Fisher test. We define an unrestricted model,
