You might have already heard of graph analysis previously. In this article, we'll cover the basic graph notions.

For what comes next, open a Jupyter Notebook and import the following packages :

```python
import numpy as np
import random
import networkx as nx
from IPython.display import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

If you have not already installed the `networkx` paxkage, simply run :

```bash
pip install networkx
```

The following articles will be using the latest version  `2.x` of  `networkx`. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

## What is a Graph ?

A graph is a collected of nodes that are interconnected. For example, a very simple graph could be :

Graphs can be used to represent :
- social networks
- web pages
- biological networks
- ...

What can we do on a graph ?
- study topology and connectivity
- community detection
- identification of central nodes
- ...

In our notebook, let's import our first pre-built graph :

```python
# Load the graph
G_karate = nx.karate_club_graph()
# Find key-values for the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G_karate)
# Plot the graph
nx.draw(G_karate, cmap = plt.get_cmap('rainbow'), with_labels=True, pos=pos)
```

What does this graph represent ?
"A social network of a karate club was studied by Wayne W. Zachary for a period of three years from 1970 to 1972. The network captures 34 members of a karate club, documenting links between pairs of members who interacted outside the club. During the study a conflict arose between the administrator "John A" and instructor "Mr. Hi" (pseudonyms), which led to the split of the club into two. Half of the members formed a new club around Mr. Hi; members from the other part found a new instructor or gave up karate. Based on collected data Zachary correctly assigned all but one member of the club to the groups they actually joined after the split."

## Basic graph notions

A *graph* $$ G = (V,E) $$ is made of a set of :
- nodes, also called verticles, $$ V = {1,...,n} $$
- edges $$ E ⊆ V \times V $$ 

- An *edge* $$ (i,j) ∈ E $$ links nodes $$ i $$  and $$ j $$. $$ i $$  and $$ j $$ are said to be neighbors.
- A *degree* of a node is its number of neighbors

- A graph is *complete* is all nodes have $$ n-1 $$ neighbors, i.e all nodes are connected in every possible way.
- A *path* from $$ i $$ to $$ j $$ is a sequence of edges that goes from $$ i $$ to $$ j $$. This path has a *length* equal to the number of edges.
- The *diameter*

> **Conclusion** : I hope that this article introduced clearly the concept of AdaBoost and that it does now seem clear to you. Don't hesitate to drop a comment if you have any question.
