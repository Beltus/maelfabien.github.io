These notes are a summary of "Understanding Digital Signal Processing" by Richard G. Lyons.

# I. Discrete Sequences and Systems

> A signal is a time-varying physical process. 

## I.1. Discrete vs. Continuous

Signal processing is divided in 2 categories:
- **continuous/analog** signal processing : a signal continuous in time taking continuous range of amplitude values.
- **discrete/digital** signal processing : a discrete signal for which we only know values of the signal at discrete points in time.

A **continous** signal could for example be:

$$ x(t) = sin(2 \pi f_o t) $$

Where:
- `t` represents the time
- $ f_o $ represents the frequency, in Hz (number of cycles per second)
- $ 2 \pi f_o t $ is an angle measured in radians

A **discrete-time** signal quantizes the time and the signal amplitude. We might have a discrete signal taking the following form:

```
(0, 0)
(1, 0.31)
(2, 0.59)
(3, 0.81)
...
```

Where the first value is the index, and the second is the value. The discrete signal can be represented as :

$$ x(n) = sin(2 \pi f_o n t_s) $$

Where:
- n is the index (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- $ t_s $ is the time sample, i.e. the time between 2 indexs

Continuous and discrete signals can be represented as such:

## I.2. Discrete System

A Discrete System is any software operating on a discrete-time signal sequence, and producing a discrete output sequence.

A simple Discrete System could be defined by what we call  a *difference equation*:

$$ y(n) = 2 x(n) - 1 $$

When dealing with discrete systems, the absolute frequecy determination in Hz is dependant on the sampling frequency:

$$ f_s = \frac{1}{t_s} $$

So far, we only dealt with time-domain signals, meaning that these signals are expressed in terms of time as the main variable. We can also express a signal in frequency-domain. In that case, we represent a signal as being a sum of frequencies with different amplitudes.

In the frequency-domain, the plot depicting the amplitude of each frequence is called the *spectrum*. In the example above, we sum two time-domain signals:
