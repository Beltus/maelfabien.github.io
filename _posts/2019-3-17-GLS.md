In the previous article, we highlighted the need for models and estimators that handle heteroscedasticity. We'll introduce Generalized Least Squares, a more general framework.

Recall that in the OLS framework, the Best Linear Unbiaised Estimator was defined by :

$$ b = (X' X)^{-1} X' Y = \beta + (X'X)^{-1}X' \epsilon $$

We have seen previously that under heteroscedasticity, this estimator was no longer the best. It remained however a Linear Unbiaised Estimator. 

# I. The Generalized Least Squares Estimator

Suppose than we know $$ \omega $$ such that it can be split the following way by Chelesky decomposition : $$ \omega^{-1} = P'P $$, $$ P $$  a triangular matrix. 

In this case, we can build the GLS estimator by scaling the initial regression problem :

$$ Py = PX \beta + P \epsilon $$

We can define new shifted variables :

$$ Y* = X* \beta + \epsilon* $$

The resulting estimator is therefore modified too :

$$ \hat{\beta} = (X'* X*)^{-1} X'* Y* = (X^P'PX)^{-1}X'P'Py = (X' \omega^{-1} X)^{-1} X' \omega^{-1} y $$

The variance of the estimator becomes :

$$ Var( \hat{\beta} \mid X*) = \sigma^2(X'*X'*)^{-1} = \sigma^2(X' \omega^{-1} X)^{-1} $$

## 1. Weighted Least Squares

The Weighted Least Squares is a special case of the GLS framework. 

Under heteroscedasticity, we might face : $$ Var( \epsilon_i \mid X_i) = {\sigma_i}^2 = \sigma^2 w_i $$

In such case, we can specify $$ \omega^{-1} $$, which has diagnoal elements of the type $$ \frac {1} {w_i} $$

If we replace the next value of $$ \omega $$ in the GLS estimatr
