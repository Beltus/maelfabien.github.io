My name is MaÃ«l Fabien. I currently live in Paris. I have a Master in Actuarial Science (HEC Lausanne) and just finished a Specialized Master in Data Science (Telecom Paris).

I started this blog in September 2018. Since then, I have published many articles, and I currently write articles about AI for [Digital Minds](https://www.digitalminds.io/), for [Explorium](https://www.explorium.ai/) and on Medium. I'm also a Machine Learning instructor at [VivaData](https://vivadata.org/), an AI bootcamp in Paris. 

I currently am a data sciensist intern at [Anasen](https://anasen.com/), a Y-Combinator startup in Paris. I'd like to start a PhD in Machine learning related topics (continual learning, private AI, semi-supervised learning...) in 2020. 

Please [contact me](mailto:mael.fabien@gmail.com) if you think we could work together some way, or if you have any question or remark. If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects, feel free to check out my [resume](https://maelfabien.github.io/assets/files/CV_2019_MF.pdf). I'm uploading on this blog some content that I'm writing on my free time. I'm trying to upload one article per week. 

You will find here content related to my fields of interest :
- [Statistics and Machine Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/ml/)
- [Deep Learning](https://maelfabien.github.io/dl/)
- [Data Engineering](https://maelfabien.github.io/bgd/)
- [Entrepreneurship](https://maelfabien.github.io/ent/)
- [Several Projects](https://maelfabien.github.io/projects/)

I also enjoy to travel a lot and have planned a 5 months world tour for the end of 2019 (South East Asia, New Zealand, Tahiti, South America).

All codes and exercises of this website are hosted on GitHub in a dedicated repository :

You can find [here](https://maelfabien.github.io/year-archive/#) a list of all the articles I have written. I would also like to thank Henri de Feraudy who is reviewing some articles and contributes to their improvement.
